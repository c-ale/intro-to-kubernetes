Intro to Kubernetes
===================

In this course, we will discuss some of Kubernetes' basic concepts and talk about the architecture of the system, the problems it solves, and the model that it uses to handle containerized deployments and scaling.

This course offers an introduction to Kubernetes and includes technical instructions on how to deploy a stand-alone and multi-tier application. You will learn about ConfigMaps and Secrets, and how to use Ingress.

Upon completion, developers will have a solid understanding of the origin, architecture and building blocks for Kubernetes, and will be able to begin testing the new cloud-native pattern to begin the cloud-native journey.
