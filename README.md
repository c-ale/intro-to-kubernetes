Intro to Kubernetes
===================

This workshop is based on [Introduction to Kubernetes](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS158x+1T2018/) by The Linux Foundation, available for free.

In this course, we will discuss some of Kubernetes' basic concepts and talk about the architecture of the system, the problems it solves, and the model that it uses to handle containerized deployments and scaling.

Upon completion, developers will have a solid understanding of the origin, architecture and building blocks for Kubernetes, and will be able to begin testing the new cloud-native pattern to begin the cloud-native journey.
